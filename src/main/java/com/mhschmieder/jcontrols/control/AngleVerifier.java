/**
 * {@code AngleVerifier} is a specialization of {@link NumberVerifier} whose
 * main purpose is to take care of special behavior for angles, such as wrapping
 * at 360 degrees. This helps avoid false positives when checking for invalid
 * data, and also affects the data normalization tactics.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class does not override the
 * {@link NumberVerifier#verify(javax.swing.JComponent)} method, so the basic
 * verification does not account for unwrapping the period. The specialized
 * method that first verifies the absolute range and then normalizes the value
 * does do so though. This is generally the best method for clients to invoke.
 * <p>
 * As with its parent class, this verifier's utility within modern Java, even
 * when working with Swing components, is in question, due to the same caveats.
