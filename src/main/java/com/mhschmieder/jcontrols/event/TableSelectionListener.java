/**
 * {@code TableSelectionListener} is a listener dedicated to watching for table
 * selection events and interpreting them based on row and column ranges and
 * single vs. multiple selection models.
 * <p>
 * This is very old code that is no longer used in this library, so it is
 * provided at your own risk; especially given the portions that were commented
 * out a while back. It has been brought up to date style-wise and for proper
 * Javadocs documentation. My recollection is that it fell out of use solely due
 * to my conversion to an almost pure JavaFX based application code base (2015).
